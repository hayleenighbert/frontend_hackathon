# Velocity.js and SVG animations

Interesting effects with Velocity.js and vector graphics. Velocity.js is a library that loads and performs faster animations than jQuery.

# Front End Hackathon

Over the weekend, WDI students were required to finish a project with technology/languages we are unfamiliar with in order to test ourselves and ability to adapt and learn.

# Why I chose this project

The animations and UI help improve user experience when navigating a web site or web app. I wanted to experiment more with how to manipulate images and create more interesting visual aids.
