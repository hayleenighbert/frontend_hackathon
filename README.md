# Velocity.js and SVG animations

This is a front end project created for WDI at General Assembly. I played around with interesting effects using Velocity.js and vector animations (SVG). Velocity.js is a library that loads and performs faster animations than jQuery and adds more customization and control over the UI.

## Front End Hackathon

Over the weekend, WDI students were required to finish a project with technology/languages we are unfamiliar with in order to test ourselves and our ability to adapt and learn.

## Why I chose this project

The animations and UI help improve user experience when navigating a web site or web app. I wanted to experiment more with how to manipulate images and create more interesting visual aids with the use of graphic design and Javascript libraries.
